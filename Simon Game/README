Creating the classic Simon Game that will test your memory.

This project was created in order to further my skills using the JQuery library.

This classic simon memory game randomly selects between 4 different colors which the user will need to remember
and press. Once the user presses the correct color, the game will move forward and add another color onto the
existing color, creating a pattern of randomly selected colors the user will need to remember.
